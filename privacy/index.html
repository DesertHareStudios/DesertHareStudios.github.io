                    device characteristics — is collected automatically when you visit our Services.</i></p>
            <p>We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or navigate the Services. This
                information does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may
                include device and usage information, such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics,
                operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information
                about how and when you use our Services, and other technical information. This information is primarily
                needed to maintain the security and operation of our Services, and for our internal analytics and
                reporting purposes.</p>
            <p>The information we collect includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><i>Log and Usage Data.</i> Log and usage data is service-related, diagnostic, usage, and performance
                    information our servers automatically collect when you access or use our Services and which we
                    record in log files. Depending on how you interact with us, this log data may include your IP
                    address, device information, browser type, and settings and information about your activity in the
                    Services (such as the date/time stamps associated with your usage, pages and files viewed, searches,

                    or other device you use to access the Services. Depending on the device used, this device data may
                    include information such as your IP address (or proxy server), device and application identification
                    numbers, location, browser type, hardware model, Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier,
                    operating system, and system configuration information.</li>
                <li><i>Location Data.</i> We collect location data such as information about your device's location,
                    which can be either precise or imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type and
                    settings of the device you use to access the Services. For example, we may use GPS and other
                    technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on your IP
                    address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect this information either by refusing access to
                    the information or by disabling your Location setting on your device. However, if you choose to opt
                    out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the Services.</li>

            <p><i><b>In Short:</b> We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have

                    comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations,
                    to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.</i></p>
            <p><b><i><u>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</u></i></b></p>
            <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we
                rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases
                to process your personal information:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Consent.</b> We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e. , consent) to
                    use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time.
                    Click <a href="#withdrawconsent">here</a> to learn more.</li>
                <li>
                    <b>Legitimate interests.</b>We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably
                    necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your
                    interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information
                    for some of the purposes described in order to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Develop and display personalized and relevant advertising content for our users</li>

                </li>
                <li><b>Legal obligations.</b> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for
                    compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or
                    regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in
                    litigation in which we are involved.</li>
                <li><b>Vital Interests.</b> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect
                    your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential
                    threats to the safety of any person.</li>

            <p><i><b><u>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</u></b></i></p>
            <p>We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e. , express consent) to use
                your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred
                (i.e. , implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time. Click <a

            <p>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information
                without your consent, including, for example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a
                    timely way</li>
                <li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>
                <li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>
                <li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or
                    settle an insurance claim</li>
                <li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</li>
                <li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial
                    abuse</li>
                <li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or
                    the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to
                    investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</li>
                <li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court
                    relating to the production of records</li>
                <li>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and
                    the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced</li>
